## Paramount Practicum Project Showcase 
**Description**: The practicum project for Paramount involved developing a systematic method to detect consistent interactions between shows to inform content exploitation decisions. The objective was to help inform decisions evolved around enhancing user engagement.

**Tools Used**: Python (for data processing and analysis), R (for network analysis), igraph (for network graph visualization)

**Techniques**: Anomaly detection (LOESS curve fitting, Facebook Prophet, z-score, seasonal decomposition), trend removal, similarity metric calculation (Jaccard similarity, KS statistic, slope of cumulative curve), clustering

## Classification Problem
### Customer Characteristics Analysis
**Description**: This project focuses on analyzing customer characteristics to identify those most likely to respond to targeted marketing campaigns. The goal is to maximize the return on investment (ROI) by accurately targeting the right customers.

**Tools Used**: Python, scikit-learn (for machine learning models), pandas (for data manipulation), matplotlib (for data visualization)

**Techniques**: Decision trees, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), logistic regression, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) for handling class imbalance

### Predicting Customer Churn
**Description**: This project addresses the issue of customer churn for a telecommunications company experiencing a loss of landline customers to cable competitors. The project involves two main tasks: 1) inference, understanding what kind of customers are churning, and 2) prediction, developing a predictive model with high accuracy to forecast customer churn.

**Tools Used**: R, caret, ModelMetrics, pROC, keras, tensorflow, dplyr, ggplot2, xgboost, glmnet, ISLR, gbm

**Techniques**: Logistic regression, feature selection, neural networks, random forest, XGBoost, Adaboost

## Recommender System
### Supermarket Generalized Beer Recommendation
**Description**: This project involved developing a recommender system for ACSE Supermarket to increase sales of Molson Coors products by targeting Budweiser customers. The system utilized transaction data to cluster customers based on their purchasing patterns and employed logistic regression models to predict the likelihood of customers switching to Molson Coors products.

**Tools Used**: Google BigQuery (for retrieving over 1 billion rows of data), Python, scikit-learn (for clustering and logistic regression), pandas (for data manipulation and preparation),  matplotlib/seaborn (for data visualization)

**Techniques**: K-means clustering, logistic regression, association rule mining (Apriori algorithm)

**Key Insights**: Identified 42,000 potential customers for Molson Coors with tailored recommendations to support targeted marketing strategies. Association rules revealed key sub-categories influencing beer purchases, which can inform business decisions.

**Report**: [Supermarket Generalized Beer Recommendation Report](https://github.com/ywa2763/datasciportfolio/blob/faf8e99e7f5c73f85cc0d1f1c77a0e69555d68a1/Slides%20and%20Reports/Supermarket%20Generalized%20Beer%20Recommendation%20Report.pdf)

## Natural Language Processing
### Amazon Reviews Analysis
**Description**: This project analyzes 5.5 million Amazon reviews in the beauty category from 2000 to 2015 to identify trends and make recommendations for improving the user experience and optimizing product offerings for sellers. The goal is to advise Amazon on the types of reviews that customers find most useful and guide sellers on key topics that influence consumer behavior.

**Tools Used**: PySpark (for data processing, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis), AWS S3 and HDFS (for data storage and processing), Natural Language Toolkit NLTK (for text processing), Gensim (for topic modeling)

**Techniques**: Data wrangling, big data processing, topic modeling, sentiment analysis

**Key Insights**: Reviews participating in the Vine program were more helpful; non-verified purchases often had lower ratings but higher helpful ratios. Topic modeling revealed common themes such as product longevity, effectiveness, and value, with hair and skin products being particularly popular in the beauty industry. It is suggested to send post-purchase reminders for better consumer insights and focus on improving aspects highlighted in lower-rated reviews to enhance customer satisfaction.
